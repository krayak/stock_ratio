# Financial Ratios Analyser

---

## **Overview**
This project provides a structured approach to analyzing financial ratios for a company, offering detailed insights into valuation, profitability, liquidity, debt, and efficiency metrics. The analysis is summarized into recommendations for investment decisions based on industry benchmarks and the companyâ€™s performance.

This project is a Python module designed to analyze equities using various financial ratios. It focuses on valuation, efficiency, profitability, and debt metrics to provide actionable investment recommendations. The module can be installed via `setup.py` and accessed through a command-line interface (CLI).

The analysis covers the following categories of financial ratios:

- **Valuation Ratios**
- **Profitability Ratios**
- **Liquidity Ratios**
- **Debt Ratios**
- **Efficiency Ratios**

Each category contains multiple metrics that are evaluated against industry benchmarks to provide actionable recommendations.

**Special Note:**  
This framework is designed to assist in the quantitative analysis of various financial ratios and provides a consolidated output to streamline decision-making. However, it is imperative to validate the generated output and avoid blindly following the recommendations. Users should perform initial analysis and cross-check with other relevant data to ensure the soundness of investment decisions.
